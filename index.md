# Jay Rayner's Restaurant Reviews in Maps

Someone asked for this in the comments section on the Guardian

## Where the data comes from

2016 - Dec 2023

https://www.theguardian.com/food/series/jay-rayner-on-restaurants

## Updates

I might do something fancy with the data, like automatically update, show restaurants that closed down, breakdown by year etc, but for now it is what it is. Hope it's of some use to someone...
